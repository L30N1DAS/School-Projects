This game is modeled after the game show of the same name. In this version, 25 cases containing amounts of money ranging from $1 to $1000000 are randomly arranged. The player is to open cases they believe hold low values in an effort to raise the offer, which is the average of all the case values still in play. At certain times during the game, the player will be given the option to take the offer and end the game before all cases have been opened.
