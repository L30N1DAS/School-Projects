This program is a card game quite similar to Spoons. The primary objective of the game is to be the first of up to four players (one human player and potentially three computer players) to have a hand consist entirely of all four cards of a single label (e.g., Jack of Clubs, Jack of Diamonds, Jack of Hearts, and Jack of Spades. Once any player has achieved this goal, the game will immediately end.
