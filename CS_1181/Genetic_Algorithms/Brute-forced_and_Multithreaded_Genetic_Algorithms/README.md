This directory contains a brute-force version and multithreaded version of the genetic algorithm. They are included here together because they share code in some aspects.

The brute-force version of the genetic algorithm seeks to accomplish the same purpose as the original algorithm but by trying all possible combinations on a smaller set of items.

The multithreaded version of the genetic algorithm improves the original algorithm by increasing the efficiency and number of generations that can be used in the computation.
